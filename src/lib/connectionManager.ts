/**
 * ConnectionManager - is a manager that manages incoming connections and helps route requests to the proper services
 * ### ConnectionManager Overview :
 *
 * #### Architecture
 * **Frontends** - are external ports used to connect to all services following a specific protocol
 * **Backends** - are internal client connections for json-rpc services
 * **ConnectionManager** - is a message queue that routes data about the connections between the frontend and backend
 * **Frontend**(external ports)> **ConnectionManager** -> **Backend**(connections to services) -> **Services**
 *
 * #### Initialization
 * **SetupAllFrontends** - setups external facing ports
 * **SetupListenersForBackends** - handle incoming request to point to specific services by creating new connections for those services
 * #### Request flow
 * **InitialIncomingRequest** => **Frontend** => **ConnectionManager** => **CreateBackend** => **RecieveRequest** => **ForwardToServiceUsingBackend**;
